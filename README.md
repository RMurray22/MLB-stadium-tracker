User Story:

As a baseball fan and traveller:
I want to see todayâ€™s games and standings upon loading the app.
When I log in, I want my profile to show me my favorite team (and allow to set/change it).
* I want the app to keep track of the games I have seen at each stadium
** I want to be able to search a destination for games being played near there on that date.
*** I want to friend other users and compare stadiums visited
